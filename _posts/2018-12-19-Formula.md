In the 17-18 school year, I worked on the high voltage system in our car's battery.

### Discharge Circuit

The purpose of the discharge board is to connect the high voltage capacitors inside of our motor controller across a power resistor to remove all the high voltage outside of the battery when the car initiates a shutdown.

The board also has tractive system measuring points connected to a set of power resistors to allow members to safely measure the battery voltage.


### Accumulator Interface Board
The board connected the external connector of the battery to the necessary internal components.
