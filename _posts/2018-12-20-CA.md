Game of life (GOL) is a popular cellular automata designed by British mathematician John Conway. Cellular automata in general are effective at computing more natural phenomana like fluid flow or biological interactions. GOL, in particular, is a Turing complete automata that allows any computational structure to be built with its basic set of rules.

Taking this idea, I worked on implementing a basic component of a CPU, an Adder, in the Game of Life environment.

## Building Blocks
In order to replicate an Adder, I needed a few logic gates as well as wires to connect the logic gates together. In the Game of Life, our team replicated a wire as a stream of gliders where the presence or absence of a gliders would indicate a high or low voltage respectively.

### Routing
In order to guide and turn the gliders we needed the following structures:

#### Turn

#### Bifurcation

#### Delay

### Logic Gates
We used the following gates to construct our Adder.

#### AND

#### OR

#### XOR

## Finished Adder
The following image is our complete adder.

Each binary number is entered in either the A or B slots. The sum of the two binary numbers is represented in the sum outputs. If the adder overflows, the C-Out becomes true.
